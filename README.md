# Random Drawing from weighted entries

This is a simple html/javascript application that takes names and number of entries in a JSON file, and creates a visual representation of a drawing.  Initially the application displays the distribution of the entries, and up on clicking "Shuffle", it applies a Fisher-Yates algorithm, then redraws the display to show the randomly shuffled entries.  A second button allows for picking 2 random entries from the shuffled entries, again with the Fisher-Yates algorithm.
